# esp32-c3-digital-dice
Simple digital dice using ESP32-C3 Super Mini with 1.3" OLED display and momentary button.
Main objective is to learn more about git/github and microcontrollers/c.

## Hardware Components
- ESP32 C3 Super Mini
- 1.3" OLED Display
- Momentary Push Button
- Dupont wires


## Test Wiring
The idea is to print a cubical casing and power the whole set upt with a button cell, probably CR2477 as we will probably have vertical space to spare, but first we will build a working prototype powered by the usb-c port.
